# Todos

## Comments

src/Android/StreamingAudioService.java:45:    AndroidPlayerState _state = AndroidPlayerState.Idle; // TODO can we merge this with android's state stuff?

src/Android/StreamingAudioService.java:96:    private int MoveToNextPlaylistTrack() // {TODO} THIS NEEDS TO CHOP OFF THE END OF THE HISTORY BEFORE PUSH

src/Android/StreamingAudioService.java:603:        // {TODO} why stop the service?

src/iOS/LockScreenControls.uno:116:            // {TODO} lower version support

## debug_log to be removed

- src/Android/StreamingPlayerAndroidImpl.uno:81   how should we communicate OnRejected?
- src/Android/StreamingPlayerAndroidImpl.uno:165   how should we communicate onServiceDisconnected?
- src/Track.uno:80 Implement TryConvert so we can use IDs for diffing

## Testing Driven

- fix up the example
 - click on tracks would be a good start
 - example: tap seem doesnt work, drag does though

- Seems to be possible in some cases to use backward to get to entries from previous playlists..which is itself is fine, but it seemed intermitant and (on android) I jumped back to the first playlist rather that the intermediate tracks. When do tracks get added to the history?

- optional duration? (can't work with streaming ofc)

## Done

I: Forward works even when no history
R: This is correct behaviour.

I: remove all debug_log statements (turn any critical ones into issues)
R: -

I: playlist looping by default (only on iOS)
R: -

I: you can 'next' passed the end of the queue and it wraps. Maybe this is fine?
R: Yeah, it's fine

I: test pause
R: pause is fine

I: play always resets on iOS, should unpause when paused
R: -

I: add option to specify default 'next' behaviour
R: was taking a lot of time to get correct. Have moved to own branch so we can ignore it for now

I: dont jump to -1 when run out of tracks
R: nope. at least, not for now

I: make play on -1 calls next
R: -

I: Android not clearing controls on stop
R: -

I: notification being set on seek
R: -

I: not setting artwork causes crash
R: -

I: make more fields optional
R: -

I: android: Add support for local artwork files
R: -

I: example has 'onvaluechanged needs a module' warning
R: -

I: android artwork caching
R: dirt simple but will do the job for now.

I: on iOS, when playlist is done we keep getting 'Note' in the logs
R: At end of playlist we now call Stop()

I: iOS: Add support for local artwork files
R: -
