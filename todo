# Todos

## Testing Driven

- fix up the example
 - click on tracks would be a good start
 - example: tap seem doesnt work, drag does though

- optional duration? (can't work with streaming ofc)
 - what is the correct 'we dont know' length?

- android: service:660 & 279 move to error state?

- When we are playing from history the next track should be from history, not playlist.
  Do we do this?
  Hmm I think we can just use forward always. As then when in history it just works and
  when there is no history then it uses the playlist. Cool!

- ios: double play on switch track

- add clear history

- add 'set current track'

## Done

I: Forward works even when no history
R: This is correct behaviour.

I: remove all debug_log statements (turn any critical ones into issues)
R: -

I: playlist looping by default (only on iOS)
R: -

I: you can 'next' passed the end of the queue and it wraps. Maybe this is fine?
R: Yeah, it's fine

I: test pause
R: pause is fine

I: play always resets on iOS, should unpause when paused
R: -

I: add option to specify default 'next' behaviour
R: was taking a lot of time to get correct. Have moved to own branch so we can ignore it for now

I: dont jump to -1 when run out of tracks
R: nope. at least, not for now

I: make play on -1 calls next
R: -

I: Android not clearing controls on stop
R: -

I: notification being set on seek
R: -

I: not setting artwork causes crash
R: -

I: make more fields optional
R: -

I: android: Add support for local artwork files
R: -

I: example has 'onvaluechanged needs a module' warning
R: -

I: android artwork caching
R: dirt simple but will do the job for now.

I: on iOS, when playlist is done we keep getting 'Note' in the logs	
R: At end of playlist we now call Stop()

I: iOS: Add support for local artwork files
R: -

I: history broken
R: -

I: communicating OnRejected & onServiceDisconnected
R: log & set Status to Error

I: Track does not override object.GetHashCode()
R: -

I: SetPlaylist should add the uids
R: -

I: add GetPlaylist
R: playlist is now a NativeProperty

I: android: killing app doesnt remove notification
R: -

I: support lower ios versions
R: - wont worry about version yet

I: NSAppleMusicUsageDescription Permissions crash
R: easy to fix by using unoproj plist option in example

I: Simplify AndroidPlayerState situation
R: Removed it and now use PlaybackStateCompat instead

I: iOS - Always reuse the player, new player should happen only once
R: -

I: iOS - Consolidate Add/Remove Observer logic (Track the Observed things)
R: -

I: iOS: backward to beginning of history can result in only playing first track and stopping.
R: backward could return -1 and we would then set this as the current track (meaning no next track)

I: fix get playlist
R: -
